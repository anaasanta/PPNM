EXPLANATION OF THE EXERCISES:

EXAM:
        Implement a (one-dimensional) adaptive recursive integrator which at each iteration subdivides the interval 
        not into two, but into three sub-intervals. Reuse points. Compare its effectiveness with the adaptive integrator 
        from your homework.

        For example, a rule like this (check that the numbers are correct),

        xi={1/6,3/6,5/6} reusable points for division by 3;
        wi={3/8,2/8,3/8} trapezium rule; (check this)
        vi={1/3,1/3,1/3} rectangle rule; (check this)

1. Check the values of wi and vi:

    Following what is shown in the chapter of integration, we can find if the values of wi and vi are correct.

    1) wi ( Trapezium rule, upper rule): As seen in section 1.3, we have 3 nodes in the interval [0,1]. Then, we can   
    as base functions the polynomials of degree 0, 1, 2. 
    - ϕ1(x) = 1, ϕ2(x) = x, ϕ3(x)=x^2       (Newton-Cotes)
    On page 5, we can see we end up having:
        Integral from 0 to 1 of ϕ1(x) = 1 = w1 + w2 + w3
        Integral from 0 to 1 of ϕ2(x) = 1/2 = w1/6 + 3*w2/6 + 5*w3/6
        Integral from 0 to 1 of ϕ3(x) = 1/3 = w1/36 + 9*w2/36 + 25*w3/36
    
    Solving the equations we get: w1 = 3/8, w2 = 2/8, w3 = 3/8

    2) vi (rectangle rule, lower rule): The rectangle quadrature is the one found in (6)
    Normally, ∆xi is taken as (b-a)/n and xi the center of each subinterval. 
    Because we normalized [a,b] as [0,1] and n=3, v1=v2=v3 = 1/3


2. First comparison of the adaptive integrators

    The first thing I did is compare the adaptive integrator done for this exam with the one we did in exercise A of the 
    homework, using two interesting integrals we treated before. 
    As we can see on the results found in Out.txt, both integrators give similar values. However, the old integrator did on the 
    homework gives better results. This can be because, even though dividing into 3 instead of 2 can give more flexibility 
    in some cases, in these examples takes away a bit of the percision. 

    Doing comparisons around the error function (plotting and comparing with tabulated values and caclulation of erf(1) with eps=0
    and decreasing accuracy) we cannot see any significant difference between the two integrators.
